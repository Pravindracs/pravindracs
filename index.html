    <div class="card">
      <p>I am a Doctorate Candidate in the School of Computer & Information Sciences at University of Hyderabad. My research interests include Machine Learning, IoT, Digital Twin in Healthcare, and Wireless Body Sensor Networks.

        <div class="card">
        <p><b>Intelligent Fault Detection in WSNs</b></p>
	Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely used in healthcare, smart cities, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation, but their performance is highly affected by faults such as sensor malfunctions, node failures, communication errors, and environmental interference. Traditional threshold-based fault detection 	methods lack adaptability and scalability. Intelligent fault detection integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and 	machine learning (ML) techniques to autonomously identify, classify, and correct faults in real time. By 	leveraging supervised and unsupervised learning, anomaly detection, and deep learning approaches, these systems 	enhance accuracy, robustness, and energy efficiency. With the adoption of edge computing, federated learning, and 	digital twin technologies, intelligent fault detection enables WSNs to evolve into reliable, self-healing, and 	adaptive sensor networks, ensuring trustworthy data acquisition in critical applications.
	<p><b>Edge Computing Based Real-Time Smart Fault Detection</b></p>
	The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has accelerated the demand for real-time and intelligent fault detection mechanisms. Traditional cloud-based fault detection methods often suffer from high latency, bandwidth limitations, and energy inefficiency. Edge computing addresses these 	challenges by enabling computation close to the data source, thus reducing response time and enhancing 	scalability. Integrating edge intelligence with machine learning (ML) allows for real-time smart fault detection, 	where faults such as sensor malfunctions, communication errors, and environmental interferences are autonomously 	identified and corrected. This approach ensures low-latency, energy-efficient, and adaptive operation in critical 	domains like healthcare, industrial IoT, smart cities, and environmental monitoring.
